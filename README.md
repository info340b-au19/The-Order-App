Created by Mingyi Yang and Eric Ng

In the restaurant industry, the only popular app that are commonly used are Uber Eats, Door Dash, Grubhub, etc. The "Order" App that we created take popular features from these apps and combines it with many other features that are not normally utilized. The point of the app is to equip the customer with more information. This application could be described as an all-in-one app/universal app for every restaurant that agrees to take part in it. What this app stands out from the few apps already in the restaurant industry is its review system. Rather than the usual reviews on restaurant, each restaurant will have reviews on their dishes instead. The app that we devised also has a service app that allows the user to notify the restaurant when help is needed. What we also envisioned this app will do in the future is to give real-time information to the users on their order like when the order is being made. With the current prototype that has already been built, we hope that this app joins the other dominant apps as a competitor once it becomes more developed.

**NOTE: This app is current designed mainly for: Desktop, iPhone X, and Samsung Galaxy S10+. Other sizes may have some issues, but it is ultimately recommended to use this app on the devices listed until more are implemented.**

## Current Features:
1. The app in theory finds local restaurants and new restaurants for the user to try.
2. Upon choosing a restaurant, the user is able to join the queue for dining in or for take out delivery if theres a wait.
3. While dine-in users can use the service tab to request help if needed.
4. Dine-in users and delivery users can use the menu tab to explore different dishes on the restaurants menu.
   - In the menu tab, users can order their desire dishes.
   - Each dish on the menu has a review tab that contains reviews of the dishes itself rather than reviews of the restaurant.
5. Order tab that contains the user's bill.



## Features that will be implemented in the future:
1. Rather than having estimated time, Real-time tracking for food that is being prepared.
2. Implement Google API for finding local restaurants and new restaurants for the user.
3. Style the app for all devices. Currently, the devices that this app is designed for is Desktop, iPhone X, and the Samsung S10+
4. My Order check out button does not do anything, will implement feature.
