        <h1>Problem Description</h1>
        <p>The problem I want to tackle is the amount of technology implementation in the restaurant industry. There are some
            apps that have already created a platform like <strong>Uber Eats</strong>, <strong>Postmates</strong>, <strong>Door Dash</strong> 
            that enable users to order food from the comfort of their mobile phone, but that is mainly it. I wanted to create an
            application for the restaurant industry that gives us customers additional information in the different areas that
            need them. These apps can also be equipped with other support utilties that cover the needs of customers.
        </p>

        <h2>Areas that need improvement:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Restaurants already have reviews on the restaurants themselves. However, there are no reviews for what they
                serve. Having reviews on the goods that they serve can be a helpful decision for customers to choose what 
                they believe is a good choice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Real-time information on preparing the food. This can be implemented in different scenarios.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When ordering online or takeout, we are usually only given a estimate time for when the food will be
                        ready. Instead of having estimated times on when the food will be ready, have real-time information
                        track phases of the food and the exact ready time. This would have to be easily customizable for every
                        restaurant with the many unique foods that are served. The only restaurant that I have seen do something
                        similar to tracking an order is dominos. This is fairly easy for them to do because they are mostly known
                        for selling pizza.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When eating at a restaurant, have an app that lets you know the ready-time of everything that you have ordered.
                        This allows the customer to have more access to information while they are waiting for their food. There are times
                        also when you order the restaurant might forget to make certain foods that you have ordered. There are also certain
                        situations where food might be delayed and the customer will be able to know with this app. <strong><small>
                        A real life example for me is when I went to a Korean BBQ restaurant and they did not have their rice cooked in time 
                        for when all the meat came out. They did not let us know, so we were waiting a long time without knowing what is wrong. 
                        Also, they forgot one of our dishes that we had ordered. It was already too late when we asked where it was after we ate 
                        most of our foods.</small></strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The application can also be tailored to restaurant customerservice. There are times when the waiter/waitress is unable to be as
                attentive to every table's wants and needs. Having an app that can call a waiter for something specific can save time, effort, etc.
                <strong><small>Ex. I need water, utensils, napkins: just press a button on an app to notify them. Want to order another thing, just order it on
                the app and add it to the bill. Just finished eating and need the bill: just press a button to have the bill brought to ur table, or pay
                using an electronic wallet.</small></strong>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>App Description</h1>
        <p>
            The audience of this application will be for those who usually order food to-go, delivery, and people who are regulars. In theory this application
            could potentially become a universal application that most restaurants adopt. Most restaurants would have the same utilties/functions like "please
            bring water, napkins, utensils" or "I would like to add ____ to the order" or "We are finish and ready for the bill." The point for the application
            is to make a restaurant experience much better than it is right now for returning customers and perhaps make the experience for new customers who have
            never been to that restaurant amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, there are reviews for restaurants but there arent reviews for what they serve. This can give a more in depth experience of each dish that
            the restaurant serves. This application is also trying to add real-time tracking rather than estimate time tracking. This allow users to utilize the time
            that ordering food for delivery or dining-in. As I said earlier, the only application in the restaurant industry are delivery applications, and even then
            those can be still improved.
