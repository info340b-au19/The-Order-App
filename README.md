## INFO 340 PROJECT
Created by Mingyi Yang and Eric Ng

In the restaurant industry, the only popular app that are commonly used are Uber Eats, Door Dash, Grubhub, etc. The "Order" App that we created take popular features from these apps and combines it with many other features that are not normally utilized. The point of the app is to equip the customer with more information.

# Features:
1. With location, the app finds local restaurants and new restaurants for the user to try.
2. Upon choosing a restaurant, the user is able to join the queue for dining in or for take out delivery if theres a wait.
3. While dine-in users can use the service tab to request help if needed.
4. Dine-in users and delivery users can use the menu tab to explore different dishes on the restaurants menu.
   - In the menu tab, users can order their desire dishes.
   - Each dish on the menu has a review tab that contains reviews of the dishes itself rather than reviews of the restaurant.
5. Order tab that contains the user's build.

# Explaination:
This application could be described as an all-in-one app/universal app for every restaurant that agrees to take part in it.
